    <h2>Types of Allergies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Drug Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>True <strong>allergies to drugs</strong> (medicines) occur in only a small number of people. Most
                drug reactions are not allergic, but are side effects of the properties of the medicine.
                A diagnosis of the cause of the drug reaction is usually based only upon the patient’s history and
                symptoms.Sometimes skin testing for drug allergy is also done.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Food Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>
                There are different types of allergic reactions to foods. There are differences between
                <big title="part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on 
            mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of">IgE</big>-mediated allergies,
                <big title="A non-IgE mediated reaction involves the immune system’s T-cells, not IgE antibodies. 
            This type of reaction usually causes a delayed onset of symptoms after ingesting a particular food. 
            The delay can be hours or days.">non-IgE</big>
                mediated allergies and food intolerances.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Insect Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>
                Bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets and fire ants are the most common stinging
                <strong>insects that cause an allergic reaction. </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-stinging insects can also cause allergic reactions. The most common are cockroaches and the
                insect-like dust mite. Allergies to these two insects may be the most common cause of year-round
                allergy and asthma.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Latex Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>
                A <em>latex Allergy</em> is an allergic reaction to natural rubber latex. Natural rubber latex
                gloves, balloons, condoms and other natural rubber products contain latex. An allergy to latex can
                be a serious health risk.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Mold Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>
                Mold and mildew are fungi. Since fungi grow in so many places, both indoors and outdoors,
                allergic reactions to mold can occur year round.
            </p>
            <li>Pet Allergy</li>
            <p>Allergies to pets with fur are common. It is important to know that an allergy-free (hypoallergenic)
                breed of dog or cat does not exist.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Pollen Allergy</strong></li>
            <p>
                Pollen is one of the most common triggers of seasonal allergies. Many people know pollen allergy as
                <strong>“hay fever,”</strong> but experts usually refer to it as <strong>“seasonal allergic
                    rhinitis.”</strong>
