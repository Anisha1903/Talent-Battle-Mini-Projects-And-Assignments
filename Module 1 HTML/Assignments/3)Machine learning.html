    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>

    <p>In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their experiences with their
        learning capability, and we have computers or machines which work on our instructions. But can a machine
        also learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here comes the role of <strong>Machine
            Learning.</strong></p>

    <p>Machine Learning is said as a subset of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> that is mainly concerned
        with the development
        of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own. The term
        machine learning was first introduced by <strong>Arthur Samuel</strong> in <strong>1959</strong> We can
        define it in a summarized way as:</p>

    <font  face="Arial" style="text-align: center;" size="3">
        <blockquote><q>Machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance<br>
                from experiences,
                and predict things without being explicitly programmed.</q></blockquote>

    <h2>How does Machine Learning work</h2>

    <p>A Machine Learning system <strong>learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it
            receives new data, predicts the output for it.</strong> The accuracy of predicted output depends upon
        the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more
        accurately.</p>
    <p>Suppose we have a complex problem, where we need to perform some predictions, so instead of writing a code
        for it, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, and with the help of these algorithms, machine
        builds the logic as per the data and predict the output. Machine learning has changed our way of thinking
        about the problem. The below block diagram explains the working of Machine Learning algorithm:</p>

    <h2>Features of Machine Learning:</h2>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.</li>
        <li>It can learn from past data and improve automatically.</li>
        <li>It is a data-driven technology.</li>
        <li>Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classification of Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Supervised learning</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Unsupervised learning</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Reinforcement learning</h4>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
        <img src="Classification of Machine Learning.png" alt="Classification of machine learning">
        <figcaption>Fig3. Classification of Machine Learning</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ol type="1">
        <li style="color:darkslateblue">
            <font size="5">Supervised learning:</font>
        </li>

        <dl>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the
            machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.</dl>

        <dl> The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data,
            once
            the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether
            it is predicting the exact output or not.</dl>

        <dl>The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is
            based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the
            teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.</dl>
        <dl>Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:</dl>
        <ul type="circle">
            <h4>
                <li>Classification</li>
                <li>Regression</li>
            </h4>
        </ul>

        <li style="color:darkslateblue">
            <font size="5">Unsupervised learning:</font>
        </li>

        <dl>Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.</dl>

        <dl>The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or
            categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of
            unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with
            similar patterns.</dl>

        <dl>In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful
            insights from the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:
        </dl>
        <ul type="circle">
            <h4>
                <li>Clustering</li>
                <li>Association</li>
            </h4>
        </ul>

        <li style="color:darkslateblue">
            <font size="5">Reinforcement learning:</font>
        </li>

        <dl>Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for
            each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these
            feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the
            environment and explores it. The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it
            improves its performance.</dl>

        <dl>The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement
            learning.</dl>
