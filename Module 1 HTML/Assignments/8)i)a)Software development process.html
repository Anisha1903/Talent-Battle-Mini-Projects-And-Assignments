    <h1>Software Development Process</h1>

        <p>Any software engineer should have enough knowledge to choose the right software development life cycle
            models. So that, to use it effectively, let’s see how SDLC can speed up the development process and even reduce costs:</p>

        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>Requirement analysis</li>
            </h3>

            <p>At first stage, all you need to do is about deciding what you’re going to develop. If you developing for
                clients, this will discuss their needs, goals, and expectations.
                During the first phase of software development life cycle, outline the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Answer questions such as: How will the software be used? Who is going to use the software?</li>
                <li>Next, analyze those requirements for feasibility and validity: cost, performance,
                    functionality.</li>
                <li>Then, evaluate the scope of project and identify available resources.</li>
                <li>Lastly, consider project opportunities and risks in each software development life cycle phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>UI/UX Design</li>
            </h3>
            <p>The second phase of the software development life cycle is where the entire architecture of the
                future project is created. During the design phase, testers come up with testing strategy
                like what needs to be tested, and how it needs to be tested.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every required component specifies systems architecture, configurations, data structure.</li>
                <li>Desired output including prototypes, pseudocode.</li>
                <li>Design details like the functional logic, interface details, dependency issues, and errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, in website development, where functionality is limited,
                design phase involve the creation of a very limited prototype before development begins.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Software Development</li>
            </h3>
            <p>After all requirements analysis and design choices are already defined, the actual coding starts.
                In fact, this is the longest phase of the entire software development lifecycle.</p>

            <p>But, you should consider how the project moves between different members of your team to avoid any
                dependencies. (for example, front-end and back-end developers, web and mobile developers)</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Testing and Quality Assurance
            </h3>
            </li>

            <p>Once the code is fully created, testing is carried against the requirements.
                The testing phase of SDLC is about quality assurance.
                Testing also involves the checking of any faulty parts of the code and their fixes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Develop a test plan based on the predefined software requirements.</li>
                <li>Identify the resources available for testing such as instructions and assignments for testers,
                    selects types of tests and reports to technical executives.
                <li>Work collectively with development teams to improve test results.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>Deployment</li>
            </h3>

            <p>After the software has been tested, the final deployment takes place. But, this is not as simple as the
                click of a button.
                There are a lot of things to consider in this software development life cycle process, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Who will give the final approval before launch?</li>
                <li>Do you launch it to everyone in production or selected users?</li>
                <li>If there are issues with the deployment, what will you do next?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the final phase of the SDLC, it’s important to acknowledge that all software requires maintenance.
                If users find any issues, the problem can be fixed in the next release.
            </p>

            <p>It can be useful to plan for that, which includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How often maintenance is required?</li>
                <li>What the maintenance process looks like?</li>
                <li>What to do if a product has a bug?</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
