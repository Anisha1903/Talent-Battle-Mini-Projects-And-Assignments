        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>The Idea</li>
            </h3>
            <p>The key to every successful business lies in a <strong>unique and strong idea</strong>.
                Now, <strong>how can you get an idea </strong>about beginning a startup? Getting caught up in the
                glamour
                of successful startup stories is
                easy.</p>

            <p>However, because of the proliferation of overnight success stories, too many dive into entrepreneurship
                without a proper idea or plan, limiting their chances of fortune and glory. So if you’re hoping to
                hit it big in the technology sector, you need to start with a strong tech business idea.</p>

            <h3>How to identify a great idea for your Tech Startup?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Look for problems</li>
                <li>Find a problem that interests you more</li>
                <li>Find an innovative solution</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>Thorough Planning & Market Research</li>
            </h3>
            <p>So, now you have a great idea for your tech business. Now, it’s time to do a bit of research, which
                actually means doing extensive research.</p>

            <p>Here’s a bitter truth:</p>

            <p>For a startup to be truly market-driven, it must observe, engage, and continuously listen to the market
                system.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Go-to-Market Strategy</li>
            </h3>

            <p>The go-to-market strategy is marketing your product before <strong>reaching a product-market
                    fit</strong>.
                Many people think marketing or sales is a black box. But with analytics and several neew
                technologies,entrepreneurs can optimize their products from a very early stage to accelerate
                business.</p>

            <p>A go-to-market strategy starts with a strong value proposition, so once you are clear on your value
                proposition, bring clarity on what the offering is, who the customers are, and how the customers can be
                reached.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Build a Technical Team</li>
            </h3>

            <p><strong>Build a technical team</strong> to start your tech business is inevitable.
                Finding an efficient team to implement the project is one of the major problems most start-ups face.</p>

            <p> With tight budgets and tighter deadlines, try to grab the experts from the market.
                Choose professionals based on your business niche, project scope, and specifics, etc.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD)</li>
            </h3>

            <p>PRD describes the product you want to build. It drives the efforts of the entire team that includes
                design,
                development, marketing, and customer support. The purpose of this document is to clearly
                identify the product’s objective, its features, and functionalities.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li>
            </h3>

            <p>Finally, this is the process where you will be working on your product development life cycle.
                MVP is the most basic version of your product (built quickly and cheaply), which aims to validate if
                people are interested in your business and are willing to pay for it.</p>

            <p>This phase includes product design and development, which is an essential part of the entire
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/8)i)a)Software%20development%20process.html">software development process</a>
                where the team gathers, defines the app requirements, creates the prototype and tests the solution with
                end-users.

            <p>Why is MVP required?</p>

            <p>Generate early leads</p>
            <p>Know Customer feedback</p>
            <p>Saves time and money</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Formulate a Business Plan</li>
            </h3>

            <p>A business plan plays an indispensable role when starting a start-up. The business plan includes
                all the necessary aspects of a business, including the business goals, strategies, the time frame
                of goals, details about profit and loss, finances, marketing methodologies, etc.</p>

            <p>Even the most efficient and cheapest tech start-up idea is going to require money to get off the
                ground
                and that’s why it’s
                important to secure money to fund your business as soon as possible.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Name your Start-up & Understand the Legalities</li>
            </h3>

            <p>Naming your start-up may seem like an easy thing, but it is actually not. Make sure to choose a name
                that resonates with your <strong>business idea</strong>; keep it simple and easy to understand.</p>

            <p>Understanding the legalities of starting a tech company should start right from the concept stage.
                Some do not take these considerations, which later make legal mistakes that affect the company badly.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>Branding, Website & Launch</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <h4>
                    <li>Branding:</li>
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Once the funding is done, begin the actual work of building your organization on different levels.
                    Branding your tech startup essentially means establishing an identity creating
                    its own voice, image, and personality that makes it recognizable to your customers.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    <li>Website:</li>
                </h4>
                <p><strong> Creating a website</strong> is another crucial factor because it is the best platform that
                    helps
                    you to stay active
                    in this competitive market and easily interact with your customers.</p>

                <h4>
                    <li>Launch:</li>
                </h4>

                <p> After completing all the above-listed factors, your tech startup is now set to launch.
                    <strong>Before
                        launching your startup</strong>, be
                    prepared to launch campaigns that will help you launch better in the market.</p>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>Marketing Strategies</li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                To avoid failure, market your business. For this, you need to
                understand the industry, the competitor, the upcoming trends, and the market strategically.
