        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Mysore Palace</h1>
        <p><strong>Mysore Palace</strong>, also known as <strong>Amba Vilas Palace</strong>, is a historical palace and
            a royal residence (house). It is
            located in <em>Mysore, Karnataka</em>. It used to be the official residence of the <em>Wadiyar dynasty</em>
            and the seat of
            the <em>Kingdom of Mysore</em>. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the <em>Chamundi
                Hills</em> eastward. Mysore
            is commonly described as the <big>'City of Palaces'</big>, and there are seven palaces including this one.
            However, the
            Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</p>

        <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as <em>mysuru</em> (literally, "citadel").
            <em>Yaduraya</em> built
            the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple
            times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of
            stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace
            burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous
            <em>tourist attractions in India</em>, after the <em>Taj Mahal</em>, with more than six million annual
            visitors.
        </p>

        <p>The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during a wedding in 1896.
            Maharaja<em> Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV</em> and his mother Maharani <em>Kempananjammanni Devi</em> commissioned
            the British
            architect <em>Henry Irwin</em> to build a new palace. E.W. Fritchley worked as a consulting Engineer.
            Meanwhile,
            the royal family stayed in the nearby <em>Jaganmohan Palace</em>. Construction was overseen by an executive
            engineer
            in the Mysore Palace division. He conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to <em>Delhi,
                Madras, and Calcutta</em>, and these were used to plan the new palace. The construction cost was placed
            at Rs
            41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and the palace was completed in 1912.</p>

        <p>The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall
            wing) during the reign of Maharaja <em>Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.</em></p>
