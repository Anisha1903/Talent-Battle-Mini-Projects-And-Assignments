        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Halebeedu</h1>
        <p>Halebeedu (formerly known as Dwarasamudra) was the ancient capital of the Hoysalas just 17 km away from
            Belur. The Hoysala dynasty ruled over much of South India for close to 200 years and during this time they
            built spectacular temples; both Hindu as well as Jain. In the 14th century, the armies of Alauddin Khilji
            and Muhammad Tughlak defeated the Hoysalas and raided their empire. It is recorded that enormous wealth and
            riches were looted. The city never recovered and fell into neglect. In fact, Halebeedu means <strong><q>old
                    house/ old
                    ruins</q></strong>. However, few temples survived this devastation like the ones in Halebeedu and
            today when you see
            them, you will be mesmerised by some the most stupendous expressions ever sculpted in stone. </p>

        <h2 style="color:maroon">Hoysaleshwara Temple</h2>
        <p>The Hoysaleswara Temple poised on a star-shaped base on the lawn is an architectural marvel. This
            twin-shrined temple is perhaps the largest Shiva temple built by the Hoysalas. Its base consists of 8 rows
            of friezes carved with elephants, lions, horses and floral scrolls. Its walls are adorned with intricately
            carved Hindu deities, sages, stylised animals, birds and friezes depicting the life of Hoysala kings.
            Imagery from epics like the Ramayana, Mahabharatha and Bhagavad Gita adorn the outer walls with highly
            ornate temple doorways. It is believed that no other temple in the country captures the Indian epics as
            elegantly as Hoysaleswara Temple. The Nandimantapa is positioned right in front of the temple wherein there
            is a huge Nandi richly decorated with stone ornaments. Behind this is a shrine dedicated to Surya with a 2 m
            tall image. There are exquisite carvings in the interiors of the temple as well. The most striking item is
            the highly polished lathe-turned pillars.</p>

        <h2 style="color:maroon">Other temples:</h2>
        <p>Apart from Hoysaleshwara Temple, Halebeedu is also known for Kedareshwara Temple and multiple Jain temples.
