        <p><strong>Hampi or Hampe</strong>,also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site located in Hampi town, Vijayanagara district, east-central Karnataka, India.</p>

        <p>Hampi was the capital of the <strong>Vijayanagara Empire</strong>> in the 14th century. It was a fortified
            city.
            Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a
            prosperous,
            wealthy and grand city near the <em>Tungabhadra River,</em> with numerous temples, farms and trading
            markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after
            <em>Beijing,</em> and probably
            India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was
            defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate
            armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.
        </p>

        <p>Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of <strong>Hosapete,</strong> Hampi's ruins are spread over
            4,100 hectares (16
            sq mi) and it has been described by <big>UNESCO</big> as an <q>austere, grandiose site</q> of more than
            1,600 surviving
            remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in South India that includes <q>forts, riverside features, royal and
                sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and
                others"</q></p>

        <p>Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire, it is mentioned in the <em>Ramayana</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> of
            Hinduism as <em>Pampaa</em>
            Devi Tirtha Kshetra. Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the <em>Virupaksha
                Temple,</em>
            an active <em>Adi Shankara</em>-linked monastery and various monuments belonging to the old city.</p>
