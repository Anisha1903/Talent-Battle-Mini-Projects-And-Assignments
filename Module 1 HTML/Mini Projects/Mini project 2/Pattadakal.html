        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Pattadakal</h1>
        <p>Located on the banks of the Malaprabha River, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a testament to the richness
            of Chalukyan architecture during the 7th and 8th centuries and is renowned for its intricately chiselled
            temples. The temples in Pattadakal bear testimony to the richness and timeless splendour of the Chalukyan
            architecture. It has a cluster of 10 major temples, which showcase some striking architectural features. The
            world-famous geographer Ptolemy (150 AD) has documented the town as “Perti gal”. It was even used as the
            ceremonial centre where kings were crowned and commemorated. Pattadakal has temple architecture from
            Dravidian, Aryan and a mixture of both styles in its temple complex; probably making it the only one of its
            kind in India. There is a sculpture gallery maintained by Archeological Survey of India within the
            Pattadakal temple complex.</p>

        <h2 style="color:maroon">Temples in Pattadakal</h2>

        <h3>Virupaksha Temple</h3>
        <p>The temple was built by Queen Loka Mahadevi, wife of King Vikramaditya II after the successful military
            campaigns in Kancheepuram. The temple has a vast quadrangle surrounded by small cells or shrines. It has a
            massive gateway and a small gate behind. At the entrance is a Nandimantapa supported by large pillars. The
            great hall of the temple has a roof that rests on 16 massive square columns arranged in 4 rows. These
            columns have excellently wrought episodes from the Puranas. It is believed that the Kailasa Temple at Ellora
            was built on the model of the Virupaksha Temple. </p>

        <h3>Mallikarjuna Temple</h3>
        <p>It was originally called the Trailokeswara Maha Saila Prasada and built around 740 AD by Queen Trailokya
            Mahadevi. Architecturally, almost like a twin of <strong>Virupaksha Temple</strong>, the Mallikarjuna temple
            was built for
            the same purpose, at the same time as Virupaksha temple which stands beside it. The inner walls are engraved
            with episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.</p>

        <h3>Sangameswara Temple</h3>
        <p>The Sangameshwara Temple, built during the reign of King Vijayaditya, is the earliest temple. It has a garbha
            griha with a Dravida vimana. The outer walls of the sanctum have sculptures of UgraNarasimha and Nataraja.
        </p>

        <h3>Galaganatha Temple</h3>
        <p>The Galaganatha Temple is a dilapidated temple of the 8th Century AD and has a northern style curvilinear
            shikhara. The shikhara has all amalaka motifs with a finial atop. This is a Shiva temple with a Shivalinga
            in black basalt.</p>

        <h3>Kashi Visweshwara Temple</h3>
        <p>This is another temple with a curvilinear shikhara. The inner ceiling of the Kashi Visweshwara temple has the
            figures of Shiva, Parvathi and child Skanda surrounded by the Dikpalas.</p>

        <h3>Papanatha Temple</h3>
        <p>The Papanatha Temple mentioned as ‘Mukteshwara’, seems to have been completed around 740 AD. It has a frontal
            mantapa, sabhamantapa, ante-chamber and a squarish garbhagriha. The architecture of this temple is a mixture
            of Dravida and Nagara styles.</p>

        <h3>Jambulinga Temple</h3>
        <p>This is a small temple behind the Galaganatha Temple with a curvilinear shikara. Its outer walls have figures
            of Vishnu, Ardhanarishwara and Lakulisha.</p>

        <h3>Kadasiddeshwara Temple</h3>
        <p>This is similar in design to the Jambulinga Temple. The entrance lintel has beautiful images of Shiva and
            Parvathi seated on a Nandi, flanked by Brahma and Vishnu.</p>

        <h3>Jain Temple</h3>
        <p>Outside the town is a huge Jain Basadi built in the 9th century AD. This temple has been constructed in
            Rashtrakuta style with huge elephants welcoming the visitors at the entrance.</p>
