        <p>Located about 80km from <strong>Bidar</strong>, Basavakalyan was once the capital of the Kalyana Chalukyas
            and the centre of a
            great social and religious upheaval in the 12th century. Basavakalyan in Bidar district is famed for its
            cultural heritage and is known as the Karmabhoomi of Basaveshwara, the revered 12th century religious
            reformer. During his time, it became a seat of learning, and an abode of spiritual wisdom. Basavakalyan is

            Channabasavanna and Siddarama. You can also see some monuments like the Chaluckyan Fort, few caves, and
            other places of historic and religious importance here.</p>
