        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Badami</h1>
        <p>
            23 km from Pattadakal is Badami that occupies an important place in the heritage history of Karnataka.
            Badami is picturesquely nestled at the mouth of a ravine between two rocky hills. The exquisite sculptures
            and sandstone cliffs of Badami bring forth many a tale from the yesteryears. Four rock-cut caves adorned
            with ancient carved pillars and bracket figures cut out of red sandstone is just a flight of steps away. The
            caves overlook the Agastya Theertha Lake, its banks dotted with a group of Bhutanatha Temples. Dedicated to
            Shiva’s form as the god of souls, spirits and ghosts, the Bhutanatha Temple dates back to the 7th century
            with the outer mantapa added in 11th century during the late Kalyani Chalukyan age. The caves are best seen
            at sunset when the evening sun captures the rust-red tint of the sandstone. A visit to
            <strong>Pattadakal</strong> is coupled
            with the visit to Badami and Aihole.
