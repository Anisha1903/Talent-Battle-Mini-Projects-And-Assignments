        <p>The physical education & sports was established in 2011. Physical Education is an
            integral part of educational program Regular physical education classes prepare
            sports to be physically and mentally active, fit, and healthy into adulthood.
            Through participation in various sports activities/competitions, children are
            exposed to the opportunities in sports. They can make their career in sports.</p>
        <p>The main goals in teaching modern physical education are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To expose children and teens to a wide variety of exercise and healthy
                activities. Because physical education can be accessible to nearly all children, it
                is one of the only opportunities that can guarantee beneficial and healthy
                activity in children.</li>
            <li>To teach skills to maintain a lifetime of fitness as well as health.</li>
            <li>To encourage self-reporting and monitoring of exercise.</li>
            <li>To individualize duration, intensity, and type of activity.</li>
            <li>To focus feedback on the work, rather than the result.</li>
            <li>To provide active role models.</li>
                <p>It is critical for physical educators to foster and strengthen developing
                motor skills and to provide children and teens with a basic skill set that builds their
                movement repertoire, which allows students to engage in various forms of games,
                sports, and other physical activities throughout their lifetime.</p>
                <p>These goals can be achieved in a variety of ways. National, state, and local
                    guidelines often dictate which standards must be taught in regards to physical
                    education. These standards determine what content is covered, the qualifications
                    educators must meet, and the textbooks and materials which must be used. These
                    various standards include teaching sports education, or the use of sports as
                    exercise; fitness education,relating to overall health and fitness; and movement
                    education, which deals with movement in a non-sport context.</p>
