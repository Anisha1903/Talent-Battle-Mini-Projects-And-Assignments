        <p>Our seminar halls are well-equipped with advanced sound systems and projector facilities that
            support proper training and lectures. Seminar halls are totally air-conditioned and hold a
            seminar hall capacity of more than 100 individuals. Our seminar hall facilities can be accessed
            by both our students and faculties to cater to several uses such as â€“</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Presentations</li>
            <li>Meetings</li>
            <li>Workshops</li>
            <li>Convocations</li>
            <li>Conferences</li>
            <li>Guest lectures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also access our seminar halls at the time of the induction or orientation programme for
            freshers and when representatives of several others visit our college to enlighten the students
            on the requirements of the industry that guides their learning path.</p>
