        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering , Jain Institute of Technology,
            Davanagere.
        </p>
        <p>Ours is a team of experienced, dedicated, passionate faculty members and highly aspirant, enthusiastic
            students
            and skilled non teaching staff. The Department strives to provide its students a completely interactive
            environment, guidance and a strong counseling system right from the beginning.</p>

        <p>The department has set up state of art laboratories such as Basic Electrical Engineering lab, Electrical
            Machines
            lab, Analog and Digital electronics lab, Power electronics, Microcontrollers lab, High voltage & Relay lab,
            Control systems lab, DSP lab, Project development lab & Skill lab. The faculties are encouraged to update
            and
            share their knowledge by attending workshops, conferences and many of our faculties have presented papers in
            national & international conferences and have published papers in national & international journals.</p>

        <p>We have formed an Electrical and Electronics Engineering Forum â€“ POTENZA, which serves as a platform for
            students
            to exhibit their talents. As a part of Forum activity, we invite resource persons from academics and
            industries
            to present expert talks. We have organized workshops on MATLAB, CAED, Renewable energy sources, Smart Grid,
            SCADA. We regularly organize industrial visits, power station and receiving station visits to enhance the
            academic as well as field knowledge of students. Our students are encouraged to take up internships in
            industries nearby to their native places during semester vacation. </p>

        <p>Our students have brought laurels to our department and college by winning several prizes in inter college
            technical and cultural competitions. Few projects of our final year students have been sponsored by KSCST.
            Our
            students are given placement trainings from invited experts. Our efforts have yielded good results and many
            of
            our students are placed in well-known companies such as Infosys, TCS, WIPRO, DXC, NTT Data, HCL, MU SIGMA,
            Herin
            Electronics, Volvo, Accenture, Capgemeni, ATOS, Q-Spiders, etc. Finally, our department is bound to impart
            excellent and innovative education in Electrical and Electronics Engineering to build highly competent new
            generation of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>
